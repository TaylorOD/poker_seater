# Poker Seater

# Why? 
I build this simple app for my weekly poker game. We needed a way to randomize where players were seated each week. 

# How?
This is a simple poker seat randomizer built in ruby. If you download it you can run it in VS Code or your terminal. 
You are asked to enter names (the names of players). The number array is the seat they should occupy at the table.

# What tech?
I built this in Ruby.

# Roadmap
I'd like to build a front end and host this so others can use it.
