# Poker Seater

# Why?

I build this simple app for my weekly poker game. We needed a way to randomize where players were seated each week.

# How?

This is a simple poker seat randomizer built in ruby. You can run it in your terminal, run the index.html file with live server, or visit www.pokerseater.com to use it.
You can enter names individually or as a comma separated list.

# What tech?

I built this in Ruby. This is purely to make my poker buddies believe I am actually randomizing the seating so I don't give myself the best seat every week.
