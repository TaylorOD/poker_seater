# Poker Seater

# Why? 
I build this simple app for my weekly poker game. We needed a way to randomize where players were seated each week. 

# How?
This is a simple poker seat randomizer built in ruby. If you download it you can run it in VS Code or your terminal. 
You are asked to enter names (the names of players). The number array is the seat they should occupy at the table.

# What tech?
I built this in Ruby. The code is terrible and doesnt work on uneven numbers over 10. This is purely to make my poker buddies believe I am actually randomizing the seating so I don't give myself better seats.

# Roadmap
I'd like to build a front end and host this so others can use it.
